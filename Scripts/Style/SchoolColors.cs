// SchoolColors.cs
//
// Purpose:        Maps each CardSchool to its visual identity:
//                 card border colour, mana pip colour, and the
//                 short text badge shown in the corner.
// Layer:          Style
// Collaborators:  CardUi.cs (card border + pip colours),
//                 CardLibraryUi.cs, CampusScreen.cs, ClassSelectUi.cs
//                 (anywhere a school's identity is rendered)
// See:            README §3 — six-school identity is one of the
//                 game's core design pillars
