// ============================================================
// CardData.cs
//
// Purpose:        Legacy CardData Node2D wrapper plus the shared
//                 enums (CardSchool, CardRarity, etc.) used across
//                 both the legacy data layer and the runtime layer.
// Layer:          Data
// Collaborators:  CardRuntime.cs (the actual runtime types live there)
// See:            README §7 — "CardData.cs vs CardRuntime.cs"
// ============================================================
//
// NOTE: The CardData class itself is legacy. New combat code should
// reference CardRuntime.Card / CardHalf instead. The enums in this
// file ARE the source of truth — both layers depend on them.
