// ============================================================
// ScriptingInterfaces.cs
//
// Purpose:        Core scripting interfaces for the composable
//                 card system — IEffect, IPredicate, plus the
//                 PredicateContext and EffectResult helpers that
//                 carry data between sibling effects in a
//                 sequence.
// Layer:          Runtime
// Collaborators:  Effect.cs, CompositeEffects.cs (IEffect
//                 implementations), CorePredicates.cs
//                 (IPredicate implementations),
//                 JsonCardLoader.cs (resolves JSON to these
//                 interfaces), CardRuntime.cs (CardHalf holds
//                 IEffect/IPredicate arrays)
// See:            README §5.4 (Effect Types),
//                 README §5.5 (Predicate Types)
