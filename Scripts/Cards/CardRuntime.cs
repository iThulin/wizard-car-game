// ============================================================
// CardRuntime.cs
//
// Purpose:        Runtime card model used by combat — Card, CardHalf,
//                 Ability, and the PlaySpeed enum. This is the file
//                 combat code talks to; CardData.cs is the legacy path.
// Layer:          Runtime
// Collaborators:  CardData.cs (enums), JsonCardLoader.cs (builds these),
//                 DeckManager.cs (zones / lifecycle),
//                 ScriptingInterfaces.cs (ICost, ICondition, IEffect, ITargetSelector),
//                 GameState.cs, Entity.cs
// See:            README §3 (Architecture Overview),
//                 README §5 (Card Schema Reference),
//                 README §7 — "CardData.cs vs CardRuntime.cs"
